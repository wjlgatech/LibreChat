# Voice AI Backend - Week 1 Progress

## ✅ Completed: MediaSoup WebRTC Server Setup

### What We Built

We've successfully created the foundation for the Voice AI real-time communication system:

1. **MediaSoup Server** (`src/server.ts`)
   - WebRTC media server for ultra-low latency audio streaming
   - Socket.IO for signaling and control messages
   - Transport creation for sending/receiving audio
   - Producer/Consumer pattern for audio routing
   - Health check and stats endpoints

2. **Test Client** (`src/test-client.html`)
   - Simple web interface to test MediaSoup connectivity
   - Audio capture and visualization
   - Real-time connection status
   - Server communication logs

3. **Configuration** (`.env`)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - MediaSoup RTC port range (10000-10100)
   - CORS settings for development
   - Prepared for Redis/PostgreSQL integration

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ MediaSoup worker with proper error handling
- ✅ WebRTC transport creation (send/receive)
- ✅ Audio codec configuration (Opus @ 48kHz)
- ✅ Socket.IO real-time signaling
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ TypeScript with strict type checking

### How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access test client
open http://localhost:3000/test-client.html
```

### Testing the Setup

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the test client in browser
3. Click "Connect to Server"
4. Click "Start Audio" (grants microphone permission)
5. Check server logs for successful transport creation

### Architecture Overview

```
Client (Browser/Mobile)
    ↓ (WebRTC/Socket.IO)
MediaSoup Server (Port 3000)
    ├── Worker Process (Media handling)
    ├── Router (RTP capabilities)
    ├── Transports (WebRTC connections)
    ├── Producers (Audio sources)
    └── Consumers (Audio sinks)
```

### What This Enables

With MediaSoup running, we now have:
- **Ultra-low latency**: Direct peer connections with <50ms network latency
- **Scalability**: Each worker handles ~500 concurrent streams
- **Flexibility**: Ready for STT/TTS service integration
- **Production-ready**: Built-in DTLS encryption, SRTP for secure audio

### ✅ Week 1-2 Progress Update

#### Completed:
1. **MediaSoup WebRTC Server** ✅
   - Full WebRTC infrastructure for <50ms network latency
   - Transport, Producer, Consumer management
   - Health monitoring and stats endpoints

2. **TTS Service Extraction** ✅
   - Standalone TypeScript TTS microservice
   - Multi-provider support (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Azure, LocalAI)
   - Streaming capabilities for real-time synthesis
   - RESTful API with health checks
   - Test client at `/test-tts.html`

#### TTS Service Endpoints:
- `GET /api/tts/voices` - Get available voices
- `POST /api/tts/synthesize` - Convert text to speech
- `POST /api/tts/stream` - Stream TTS for real-time
- `POST /api/tts/chunk` - Process single text chunk
- `GET /api/tts/health` - Service health check

### Next Steps (Week 2 Continuation)

2. **Add STT Service**
   - Implement streaming speech-to-text
   - Connect to MediaSoup audio producers
   - Handle partial transcripts

3. **Create Orchestrator Service**
   - Manage audio flow between services
   - Handle LLM integration
   - Implement <700ms round-trip pipeline

### Performance Considerations

Current latency breakdown target:
- Audio capture: 5-10ms ✅ (handled by MediaSoup)
- Network (WebRTC): 20-50ms ✅ (P2P connection ready)
- STT: 100-150ms (next week)
- LLM: 200-400ms (next week)
- TTS: 100-150ms (next week)
- **Total target: <700ms**

### Learning Notes

**WebRTC with MediaSoup**:
- MediaSoup handles the complex WebRTC internals
- We just manage transports, producers, and consumers
- The server acts as a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
- Audio flows: Client → Transport → Producer → Router → Consumer → Transport → Client

**Key Concepts**:
- **Transport**: WebRTC connection for sending or receiving media
- **Producer**: Source of media (microphone in our case)
- **Consumer**: Destination for media (speakers)
- **Router**: Routes media between producers and consumers

### Troubleshooting

If you see connection issues:
1. Check if port 3000 is available
2. Verify MediaSoup RTC ports (10000-10100) are not blocked
3. For production, update `ANNOUNCED_IP` in `.env` to your public IP
