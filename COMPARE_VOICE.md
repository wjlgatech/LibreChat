# Voice Recognition Issue Analysis

## Problem
Speech recognition starts and immediately ends in a loop, no transcription occurs.

## Key Differences from Working Version

### 1. Mode Checks Removed
- Working version had: `modeRef.current === 'continuous'` checks
- Current version: No mode checks, always assumes continuous

### 2. Recognition Restart Logic
- Working version: Only restarts in continuous mode AND when not waiting for response
- Current version: Missing proper guard conditions

### 3. Event Handlers
- Both versions have the same event handlers
- Issue is in the restart logic, not event handling

## Root Cause
When removing single-turn mode, we made recognition ALWAYS restart after ending. In Chrome, if no speech is detected quickly, recognition ends, then immediately restarts, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution
Need to add better conditions for when to restart recognition, similar to the working version but adapted for single continuous mode.
