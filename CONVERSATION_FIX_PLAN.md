# Conversation Continuity Fix Plan

## Root Cause Analysis

1. When `conversationId === Constants.NEW_CONVO`, the `ask` function:
   - Sets `conversationId = null`
   - Clears `currentMessages = []`
   - Navigates to `/c/new`

2. This happens on EVERY message submission if the conversation context shows `NEW_CONVO`

## Solution Strategy

### Option 1: Track Conversation ID (Current Attempt)
- Track when conversation ID changes from NEW_CONVO to a real ID
- Problem: The conversation context might still show NEW_CONVO on subsequent renders

### Option 2: Prevent Navigation on Continuous Mode
- Check if we're in continuous voice mode
- Skip the navigation to `/c/new` if we're continuing a conversation
- Problem: Requires modifying core LibreChat code

### Option 3: Use Message Context
- After first message, use the message's conversationId
- Pass it explicitly in subsequent submissions
- Problem: submitMessage doesn't accept conversationId parameter

## Recommended Fix

The best approach is to ensure that after the first message creates a conversation:
1. The conversation context is properly updated with the new ID
2. The voice component uses the updated conversation context
3. We don't trigger new conversation logic for subsequent messages

## Implementation

We need to:
1. Ensure conversation context is updated after first message
2. Wait for conversation ID before allowing next submission
3. Log and verify the conversation flow
